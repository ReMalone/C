/*Robert E Malone Program 2
  CSCE 2100 
  RobertMalone@my.unt.edu Whoever grades my code please email me what I did right/wrong
	                      I really want to know.
Update 10/18: So even with the week extended, I once again could not find a way to fix my ID problem
I tried switching my original struct code to a class when a member in my group told me too. 
It did work for the ID part however when I tried to convert my sorting algorithmm, duplicate, and removing things. It failed.
I thought it would be best for me to keep my original code for now and turn it in the way I planned
hoping someone could help me figure out what I did wrong(hopefully my grade won't suffer too bad I'm aware of this). 
By programming assignment 3 I hope to have this problem sorted out.
